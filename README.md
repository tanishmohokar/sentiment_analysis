# ✈️ Sentiment Analysis of Airline Tweets  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project performs **sentiment classification** on airline-related tweets using a **Bi-directional LSTM** with a custom **attention mechanism**.  
The model predicts whether a tweet’s sentiment is:  
- **Negative** 😠  
- **Neutral** 😐  
- **Positive** 😊  

It uses the **Twitter Airline Sentiment dataset** and applies text preprocessing, tokenization, sequence padding, and attention-based LSTM architecture for classification.

# 🧪 Sample Predictions
| Tweet                                                  | Predicted Sentiment | Confidence |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ---------- |
| The flight was delayed for 3 hours, terrible service!  | Negative            | 0.95       |
| Staff was polite and boarding was smooth.              | Positive            | 0.91       |
| It was an average experience, nothing special.         | Neutral             | 0.76       |
| I will never fly with them again. Absolutely horrible. | Negative            | 0.97       |
| Loved the extra legroom and friendly crew!             | Positive            | 0.93       |
